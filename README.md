Had alot of fun with javascript,html and css. 

Note:
When developing these games i was not that familiar with programming. The games are updated based on the computers refreshrate, and my computer at the timaThe games had a 60hz refresh rate. This means, that on a 120hz display, the games are twice as hard:)
