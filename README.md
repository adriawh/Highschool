# Highschool
A collection of small and fun things I developed in highschool.

Had alot of fun with javascript,html and css. 

Download the files and run them in your browser. They are really simple and actually quite fun. 
I would especially dare you to try gravityTurn, its not that easy to get the hang of.

Note:
When developing these games i was not that familiar with programming, the games are therefore based on the refresh rate of the computers screen. This leads to some of the games being unplayable on newer machines.
